Test Markdown Document
================

GitHub Documents
----------------

This is a test post for me to remember what I did originally. I used Andy South's terrific blog as a guide: <http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/>. Most of this .Rmd file was created by RStudio when I created a new R Markdown file using the predefined GitHub format.

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

I created a folder called \_rmd in the root directory to where I move this .Rmd file. The reason for this is that \_posts will contain a .md and a .Rmd file, but the .Rmd file is not well read by GitHub pages. I also added the option fig.path="../images/" to opt\_chunk$set() above. This places all my plots in the images folder in the root directory, as seen by the pressure plot below.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](../images/chunk13-12-2016-pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
